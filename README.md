## Description
On my high school robotics team, during the summer offseason, I worked on a solo project where I designed a [swerve drive](https://www.freshconsulting.com/insights/blog/how-to-build-a-swerve-drive-robot/), an omnidirectional drivetrain where each corner wheel can pitch and yaw to allow for turning in place, maximizing the agility of a competition robot. My final product was a swerve drive module that could be added to 4 corners of a simple tube stock rectangular frame.

## Tools and Materials
I designed this with Fusion 360. I used parts from vendors such as McMaster-Carr, IGUS, and AndyMark. I also designed several 3D printable parts and several parts to be machined out of aluminum.

## Design Criteria
1. Must Fit Within a 25"x 30" x 20" tall box
2. Chassis Weighs less than 35lbs
3. Must be driveable
4. Speed 8-14 ft/s
5. Reasonable pushing power
6. Cost must be less than $2000
7. Must be able to withstand reasonable impact
8. Must be manufacturable and repairable with the team's resources and experience

## Design Features
- Two motors, one for driving, one for turning
- Three-stage gear ratio to achieve desired speed while minimizing space required.
- Rotational sensor for programmability of yaw.
